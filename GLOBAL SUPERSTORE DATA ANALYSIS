# Context
Today, many businesses are going online and therefore online marketing is essential to retain customers. 
However, treating customers equally and targeting them with generic marketing strategies can be ineffective and even alienating. 
This is where customer segmentation comes into play as a powerful solution. 
The goal of customer segmentation is to divide the companyâ€™s customers based on their demographic characteristics (age, gender, marital status) and their behavior characteristics (types of products ordered, annual income). 
Considering the nature of the data, focusing on the behavioral characteristics of the customers in customer segmentation process is the best approach.

In this project we aim to use the following algorithms:

Clustering algorithms: This K-Means algorithm will be used to find the k number of clusters in a dataset. This will help us to divide customers into groups based on their characteristics and behaviour.

Association rule learning: This method finds the relationships between customer attributes and behaviours, such as buying habits and product preferences. 
Association rule learning can help companies understand which products are frequently purchased together and target customers accordingly.
